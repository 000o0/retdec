# RetDec

[RetDec](https://retdec.com/) is a retargetable machine-code decompiler based on [LLVM](https://llvm.org/).

The decompiler is not limited to any particular target architecture, operating system, or executable file format:
* Supported file formats: ELF, PE, Mach-O, COFF, AR (archive), Intel HEX, and raw machine code.
* Supported architectures (32b only): Intel x86, ARM, MIPS, PIC32, and PowerPC.

Features:
* Static analysis of executable files with detailed information.
* Compiler and packer detection.
* Loading and instruction decoding.
* Signature-based removal of statically linked library code.
* Extraction and utilization of debugging information (DWARF, PDB).
* Reconstruction of instruction idioms.
* Detection and reconstruction of C++ class hierarchies (RTTI, vtables).
* Demangling of symbols from C++ binaries (GCC, MSVC, Borland).
* Reconstruction of functions, types, and high-level constructs.
* Integrated disassembler.
* Output in two high-level languages: C and a Python-like language.
* Generation of call graphs, control-flow graphs, and various statistics.

## Requirements

* A compiler supporting C++14
  * On Windows, only Microsoft Visual C++ is supported (version >= Visual Studio 2015 Update 2).
* CMake (version >= 3.6)
* Perl
  * On Windows, [Active Perl](https://www.activestate.com/activeperl) needs to be the first Perl in `PATH`, or it has to be provided to CMake using `CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH` variable, e.g. `-DCMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH=/c/perl/bin`.
* [GNU Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/), [Flex](https://www.gnu.org/software/flex/), [GNU Tar](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/), `wget`, `sha256sum`.
  * On Windows, you can follow RetDec's Windows environment setup [guide](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/wiki/Windows-Environment) to help you get everything you need.

Additionally, to run the decompiler once it is built and installed the following tools are needed:
* [GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [UPX](https://upx.github.io/), [bc](https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/), [dot](http://www.graphviz.org/).
  * As before, you can follow RetDec's Windows environment setup [guide](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/wiki/Windows-Environment) to help you get everything you need on Windows.

## Build and Installation

* Recursively clone the repository (it contains submodules):
  * `git clone --recursive https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec`
* Linux:
  * `cd retdec`
  * `mkdir build && cd build`
  * `cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>`
  * `make && make install`
* Windows:
  * Open MSBuild command prompt, or any terminal that is configured to run the `msbuild` command.
  * Make sure you can run required commands listed in the Requirements section.
  * `cd retdec`
  * `mkdir build && cd build`
  * `cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path> -G<generator>`
  * `msbuild /m /p:Configuration=Release retdec.sln`
  * `msbuild /m /p:Configuration=Release INSTALL.vcxproj`
  * Alternatively, you can open `retdec.sln` generated by `cmake` in Visual Studio IDE.

You must pass the following parameters to `cmake`:
* `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>` to set the installation path to `<path>`.
* (Windows only) `-G<generator>` is `-G"Visual Studio 14 2015"` for 32-bit build using Visual Studio 2015, or `-G"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"` for 64-bit build using Visual Studio 2015. Later versions of Visual Studio may be used.

You can pass the following additional parameters to `cmake`:
* `-DRETDEC_DOC=ON` to build with API documentation (requires Doxygen and Graphviz, disabled by default).
* `-DRETDEC_TESTS=ON` to build with tests, including all the tests in dependency submodules (disabled by default).
* `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` to build with debugging information, which is useful during development. By default, the project is built in the `Release` mode. This has no effect on Windows, but the same thing can be achieved by running `msbuild` with the `/p:Configuration=Debug` parameter.
* `-DCMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH=<path>` to use Perl at `<path>` (probably useful only on Windows).

## Usage Example

To decompile a binary file named `test.bin` run:
```
./decompile.sh test.bin
```

Run `./decompile.sh --help` to list all the available options.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains the following libraries:
* `bin2llvmir` -- library of LLVM passes for translating binaries into LLVM IR modules.
* `debugformat` -- library for uniform representation of DWARF and PDB debugging information.
* `dwarfparser` -- library for high-level representation of DWARF debugging information.
* `llvm-support` -- set of LLVM related utility functions.
* `llvmir2hll` -- library for translating LLVM IR modules to high-level source codes (C, Python-like language).

This repository contains the following tools:
* `bin2llvmirtool` -- frontend for the `bin2llvmir` library.
* `llvm2hlltool` -- frontend for the `llvmir2hll` library.

This repository contains the following scripts:
* `decompile.sh` -- the main decompilation script binding it all together. This is the tool to use for full binary-to-C decompilations.
* Support scripts used by `decompile.sh`:
  * `color-c.py` -- decorates output C sources with IDA color tags -- syntax highlighting for IDA.
  * `config.sh` -- decompiler's configuration file.
  * `decompile-archive.sh` -- decompiles objects in the given AR archive.
  * `fileinfo.sh` -- a Fileinfo tool wrapper.
  * `signature-from-library.sh` -- extracts function signatures from the given library.
  * `unpack.sh` -- tries to unpack the given executable file by using any of the supported unpackers.
* Other utility scripts:
  * `decompile-all.sh` -- decompiles all executables in the given directory and subdirectories.
  * `run-unit-test.sh` -- run all tests in the unit test directory.
  * `utils.sh` -- a collection of bash utilities.

## Related repositories

* [RetDec IDA plugin](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec-idaplugin) -- embeds RetDec into IDA (Interactive Disassembler) and makes its use much easier.
* [RetDec Regression Tests](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec-regression-tests-framework) -- provides means to run and create regression tests for RetDec and related tools. This is a must if you plan to contribute to the RetDec project.
